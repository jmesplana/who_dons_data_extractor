# who_dons_data_extractor
WHO DONs Data Extractor is a tool that helps users manually extract and structure disease outbreak reports from WHO Disease Outbreak News (DONs). It uses AI to process copy-pasted reports, converting them into structured tables, mapping outbreak locations, and allowing CSV exportâ€”faster than manual entry, without web scraping.
